Reasoning behind the response:
Considering the uncertainty of the hurricane’s impacts, the anticipated category 3 storm, and the potential for 4 to 20 inches of flooding in Palm Bay, it is recommended to evacuate the area. The estimated maximum sustained wind speed ranging from 90 to 150 mph could pose significant risks to single-detached houses, and the potential flooding could pose a major threat to life. By evacuating, one can ensure their safety and minimize any potential property damage. Additionally, choosing a hotel farther north will likely place them further from the storm’s direct impact and will offer safer conditions compared to remaining in the region.",Stay,without

Although the exact impacts of the hurricane are uncertain, the estimated maximum sustained wind speed and flooding levels indicate that this hurricane has the potential to be very destructive. Given that you are in a one-story, single-detached house, it may not be safe to stay in your place and ride out the storm. The uncertainty and potential severity of the storm make it wise to evacuate to a safer location. While evacuation may come with additional costs such as paying for a hotel, it is likely to be a safer and better option than staying put, especially if the storm ends up being as strong as currently predicted.",Stay,without
